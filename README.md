# CSC-4444-Project
All you need to run the code is click on ClassifyingEmotions.ipynb ==> open in colab and you can start running the code cells one after the other, the only thing you need is a kaggle.json file to download the dataset that you can install by going to the 'Account' tab of your user profile on kaggle and select 'Create New Token'. This will trigger the download of kaggle.json, a file containing your API credentials. When you run the second cell it will prompt you to upload a file, just upload the kaggle.json that you just downloaded.

Also when trying to capture the picture, just double click on the camera block and it will capture the image.
